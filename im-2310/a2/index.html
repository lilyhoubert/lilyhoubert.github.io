<!-- Reflection
  
When designing the layout for the website I chose Hedra’a image as the source of reference. I particularly had fun with the gradient feature to add a level of interest in terms of design. 
I wanted to have a cohesive suit of boxes and decided on keeping a consistency of blue. As I felt that with the layout of the boxes your eyes travel from left to right across the screen. 
The motion inspired the decision to merge the gradient feature and use of blue. I chose a light colour on the left-hand side of the box to merge into a darker, deeper blue. 
I enjoyed this affect as I believe it creates a sense of interest while keeping a consistent design across the suite. Originally, I had a think boarder around all the boxes, I felt that this took away from the softer nature of the design.
When I removed them, I initially thought that it looked better than with the boarders, but the website design felt somewhat unfinished. I then explored further option within the coding abilities and found the shadow feature. On the top layer of boxes, I had a slight shadow surrounding the right-hand side of the box.
To maintaining the gradual fade, I changed the opacity of the shadow along the line of boxes. Hence the last box’s boarder is almost completely black. I also tried to incorporate a shadow on the bottom box but when I added it, the format looked off. Through this trial and error, I added boarder-block on the top and bottom of the box, as without anything on the outside of the final box it felt as though it was lacking. 

Another design decision I made was adding was a touch of light pink within the colour palate. As I wanted to maintain the consistency of a softer ambience and overall tone, I felt that adding particularly ‘lavender blush’ added to this objective. I added this throughout the gradient to a few of the singular boxes. 
I believe the affect created a feeling of a pink sky on a beautiful sunset. To accompany this, I chose a subtle background and continued the theme of a slight tone of pink, hence the ‘lavender blush’ is mixed with a light grey.   

One of the biggest design decisions I made was altering the heading font and putting a transition to change colour. I felt that this tied in with the aim of the overall design. Hence, the fade of gradient from pink to blue is consistent with changing from ‘lavender’ to ‘cornflowerblue’.
