        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        
        <h4> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </h4> 
        
       <p>The first thing I paid attention to was the dark aesthetic choices such as the black background. Also the most striking aspect was the liquid, dystopian and interactive audio-visual activity that you could control and manipulate with your mouse. </p> 
       
          <h4>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Initially without moving the mouse, the animation on the screen started to morph into a liquid formation. </li>
        <li>I started to move my mouse across the screen to see the liquid develop in movement.</li>
        <li>Faster the movement when hovering the mouse created more distortion to the image. </li>
        <li>I shifted the mouse to the right hand side of the screen </li>
        <li>The control panel had many different options to manipulate the graphic  </li>
        <li> I started with the mouse size slide and shifted the rate to 0.1, I saw how the mouse span enlarged </li>
        <li> Other interesting control shifters that I enjoyed testing out included the worm, gleams and turbo. </li>
        <li>A feature at the bottom left of the control panel called reset allowed the user to removed all manipulation to the graphic and start fresh. </li>
        <li> After my attention drifted from the main objective I saw the designers of the animation Mika and SinJin.  </li>
        <li>Other options within the site included a gallery at the top half of the screen showing other digital art that you can investigate </li>
        <li>A part that I noticed was in the bottom right was a speaker icon in which you could change the volume, saying this I couldn’t hear any audio from my computer and wasn’t sure if the issue was from my end of theirs.</li>
      </ol> 
     
      <h4>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>
      <p> I spent the most time engaging with the side bar of different controls. The panel allowed the user to influence the interactive experience. It was interesting watching the different setting change the nature of the liquid animation. Particularly the entropy control ignited bubbles of bright light to move around the screen. </p>
      
      <h4> What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
      <p>My most common action was shifting my mouse across the screen to see the animation move. Accompanied with this motion was clicking the different option to alternate the design.  </p> 
      
      <h4>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
      <p>Personally I believe the intended primary goal is for the user to experience an art exhibition virtually and to incorperate modern artistic digital media into the website. </p>
      
      <h4>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?
    </h4>
    <p>I believe the intended goal is effective in communicating to a global audience the possibility of digital media art. I believe an extremely enjoyable factor for the user is the interactive nature of the website and how you can control yourself how the animation can be influences. Another aspect that I feel portrays the modern aesthetic is the metallic liquid shade and texture as it helps create a dystopian scene.  </p>
       
       <h4>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? </h4>
       <p>In terms of if effectiveness over time, I do believe that the enjoyment from the website has an expiry. After you have shifted through the controls there isn’t much else to do but look at the graphic. After my first initial experience with the website I didn’t have much desire to continue engaging, I did enjoy looking at the other different art posted on the website. In saying this, I do believe the objective of the page is similar to if you saw digital art in a museum or in real life. Therefore, normally those interactions are of single engagement and the takeaway is that one moment with the design.  </p>
    
            <h4>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?  </h4>
    <p>In determining the answer to this question, I wanted to explore beyond the website to fill the missing gaps of why the artistic decided to make this. I found a YouTube video that had the audio that I believe the website was meant to generate. This answered a few curiosities of why the animation felt limited. The synth sound gave a personified feeling to the animation and allowed for the notion of a futuristic setting to become fully encapsulated. I believe the experience is a point of example and reflection to how electronic sound and modern visuals tell a new story. This is clear in the synchronisation of vibrations within the ripples of animation and the audio.  </p>
        
    <h4>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h4>
        <p>I believe the media experiences references the link between electronic music and visuals. It reminded me of particular Spotify visuals artists have created to link compositions with images. Also the particular choice in metallic graphics are similar to many techno or party posters in the current music scene. </p>
       
        <h4> What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h4>
        <p>I believe beyond the physical movements of engagement I believe it suggests to the user to think further about how different art forms can be linked. In particularly the influence of sound to a graphic. As I spent my initial moments with the website with no sound, I felt that the objective and meaning of the exhibition was short of an emotional attachment. Once I had discovered the missing element I believe understanding the intention of the site and exhibition could be fully understood. Hence, I believe that how you should act is to think about why the artist created this graphic to represent the sound.  
            </p>
           
            <h4>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h4>
            <p>My takeaway in how I should feel, is to reflect on how electronic sounds partially the use of synth progressions could be visually reimagined. Liquid Entropy alludes to the fact that the sounds are similar to the fluid substances manoeuvring across the screen.  </p>
               
                <h4>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h4>
                <p>
                    Personally I believe the most frustrating aspect was that I couldn’t get the sound incorporation to work and thus had to travel beyond the site. In saying that almost certain that was a technical problem from my end as I doubt that they would have a fully functioning site with such a large aspect missing. Besides that, another frustrating aspect was that after working through the control panel there isn’t much else to do beside reflect and think about the interactive nature. I think some information about what the meaning and point of the site would be interesting and good way to conceptually engage the audience in further.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h4>
                    <p>
                        
I believe the most satisfying element of the interaction is the control panel and visually seeing the shift in movement. I believe any sort of exhibition that involves and interactive element is extremely effective in keeping the audience engaged. It also makes you feel as though are apart of the art and that you have had an influence into the beauty of the design.
