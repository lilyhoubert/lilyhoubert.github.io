        <h3>Research Questions:</h3>
        
        <h4> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </h4> 
        
       <p>The first thing I paid attention to when entering this website was the title, font and size of the text.
        Once opened text appears larger and then positions itself into the the top left hand side of the webpage and decreases in font size as it transitions. 
         The size of the font begins larger and transitions to a smaller font, and positions itself into the top left corner. 
          I was also drawn to the colour scheme and contrast between the green text and yellow background. </p> 
       
          <h4>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>To begin I hover the mouse over title ‘ 7 Poems by Justine Nguyễn & Tiger Dingsu’, the text became underlined. </li>
        <li>I then moved my mouse below and to the right and hovered over the green rectangle, an interaction occurred whilst hovering over the shape.</li>
        <li>Whilst the mouse hovered over the shape a shadow occurred, making the shape now look like it was three-dimensional or lifting from the screen. </li>
        <li>The cursor of the mouse has changed from the triangle icon to the link selector cursor that appears as a pointing finger icon. </li>
        <li>Once clicked the shape expands and becomes a rectangle with a green border and the space within the space matches the colour of the background. </li>
        <li>Text appears directly in the centre of this rectangle and is changing without being clicked or hovered upon. </li>
        <li>Once I move my mouse outside of the rectangle the border loses its shadow and becomes a flat rectangle that no longer looks 3 dimensional. The border physically no longer has a shadow, which was creating this effect. 
        </li>
        <li>I then click on the next shape below, that is symmetrical to the shape above, as I click it the same actions occur. The box expands and words and text appear within the centre. I decide to click again, and the rectangle now fills green, the text is now the background colour and it pauses on the word I have clicked. </li>
        <li>Sound also begins to play, and as I click on more icons different sounds of pitch play simultaneously. </li>
        <li>I have now repetitively clicked each icon open and clicked again to freeze it on a specific word.  I spent some time reading through each poem, word by word. Now multiple sounds are playing at once.</li>
        <li>I then click the title in the top left corner and all the icons close, the music begins to fade and eventually comes to a complete stop.</li>
      </ol> 
     
      <h4>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>
      <p> I engaged most with the green rectangular icons. I loved the hovering interaction that added a shadow to the icons.  and enjoyed clicking to see different words freeze within the shapes.</p>
      <h4> What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
      <p>Clicking was the most common action throughout my two minute interaction. As most reactions by clicking were by definition bigger or had more change I was more eager and drawn to clicking the icons and shapes. </p> 
      <h4>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
      <p>I believe the primary goal of this interactive experience is for all the poems to be read, whether that be one at a time or simultaneously. I believe the interaction is made to be personal, and also joyful and fun, in that multiple interactions are occurring at the same time such as the sound. </p>
      
      <h4>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?
    </h4>
    <p>An interactive experience such as this allows the user to feel in power. It allows the user to explore the various poems by choice, as you are able to decide which you will read first by hovering or clicking. The primary goal is for all poems to be read, therefore the information is hidden at first and requires the user to click and action it. This then is a repetitive behaviour with all the shapes, until every shape is opened. The audio used also insists that together each sound will produce a final note, song or sound.
       As the user you are intrigued to hear all sounds play at once. </p>
       <h4>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? </h4>
       <p>The interaction feels it has come to an end once the title in the top left corner is clicked. When the title is clicked, it feels like a reset button, and all icons and shapes close up and the information and poems are no longer there. The assumed order would be to follow each poem left to right, by opening each shape up and then hitting the title to reset at the end. When the title is clicked, the sound sustains a chord for a few seconds and then fades out and becomes silent.
            This also adds to the sense that it is the end. </p>
    
            <h4>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?  </h4>
    <p>I think a major factor of how this webpage should be interacted with over time is the sound. The sounds used feel slightly uneasy, and you either want to see what other sounds can do alongside them or completely mute them. 
        The way the icons are set out from left to right, with the title placed in the top left corner also gives the sense the webpage should be interacted with from left to right. </p>
        <h4>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h4>
        <p>This experience references other media forms such as poetry, which I think is quite clearly the most obvious reference. I think this webpage also references sound and music, perhaps how notes work together to create a chord. </p>
       
        <h4> What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h4>
        <p>Poetry is a form of writing that is supposed to communicate thoughts in an interesting and unique way. By creating this interactive webpage, it is clear the author wanted their poetries and writing to be read word by word, and in a fun and exciting way.
             The sound design suggests that notes need to be played together until a chord is produced. A chord in music, is any harmonic set of pitches or frequencies that consist of multiple notes, in this interactive experience each icon acts a note to build the chord. 
            </p>
           
            <h4>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h4>
            <p>I think the emotions you experience can range from feeling super intrigued, interested and engaged. Poetry genuinely tends to be calm and gentle, but I think the way they have presented it by making the user feel like they have to watch every word in order to gain all the information brings a sense of stress and panic. It is less a calmful and relaxing experience, but more a rapid, fast and stressful one.  You are unable to go back and read information and words if you have missed them, you have to re-watch it from the start. The sound design also implies a feeling of stress and panic as the music feels harsh and flat. There is also no rhythm and the sound and movement on screen is slightly off, 
                so you feel uncomfortable or as though something is not right. </p>
               
                <h4>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h4>
                <p>
                    I think the most frustrating element of this webpage interaction is the pitch and sound the last poem in the bottom right hand corner makes. 
                    It is super high pitched, and sounds uncomfortable and uneasy. The sounds don't correlate with the movement of the text which also feels frustrating and uneasy. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I think the most satisfying element of the interaction would have to be the opening and closing of each icon. 
                        I think it was super clever to make the user search and have to explore to find the poems. 
                        It made it more interactive, fun and playful. The interactions in the webpage overall help the user keep engaged for a longer period of time.
                         I think the webpage felt easy to use and navigate, as most interactions were repetitive. You felt a sense of order, and the amount of interactions occurring were just enough to feel excited but also not feel lost or overwhelmed.
