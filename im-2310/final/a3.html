    <h1>Reflection</h1>


    <p>
        Originally, my aim was to convey the concept of growth through the work I am displaying, as it evoked imagery of a developing organism or what my lecture referred to as "digital morphogenesis." However, my overall design decisions were hindered by my limited skillset and struggles with time management. Unfortunately, my original design idea, which involved creating an animation that mirrored the movement in the video, could not be function and I had difficulty creating something with intended affect. Nonetheless, in an effort to persistently convey the notion of growth, I hoped that the process photo and my work could subtly allude to this adjective and evoke a sense of progression and advancement. To make the website more interactive I focused on the landing page and thought that I would be interesting for the user to navigate with minimal information but stills from the immersive video. I chose for the images to be conducted by a hover motion, symbolising to the user to click. I choose to do a black background to make these images stand out more. To convey a sense of information about my design process, I included a page displaying the process with lots of photos about the work. Also a small brief of information about our decision making and inform the viewer of how we got to our final result. I didnâ€™t want to have pages of reflecting about the process we took as I felt that it took away from the aesthetics. Lastly a further way for the user to navigate around the website is using the feature button to return to the main page. I felt that this gave the user some grounding to know that they are travelling through the website in the correct form. Overall, I believe if I dedicated myself more towards this task and page I think that my original idea could be achieved or at least be able to make a functioning website that is as effective as I believe the work I am displaying is.
